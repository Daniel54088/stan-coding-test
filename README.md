<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="introduction"> :pencil: Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
Welcome to the Stan coding test app! This application is built using React with TypeScript, and styled with pure CSS following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

Key Features:
* Series and Movies List: The app fetches and displays a list of series and movies by calling a provided JSON file.
* Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be user-friendly on both tablets and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across different screen sizes.

Technical Overview:
* React: Utilized for building a component-based architecture, providing a robust and scalable structure.
* TypeScript: Ensures type safety, enhances code quality, and improves developer productivity through better tooling and autocompletion.
* Pure CSS: Employed for styling, keeping the design simple and efficient. The BEM naming strategy is used to maintain clarity and modularity in the CSS.

With this setup, the app is both easy to maintain and extend, providing a solid foundation for further development.

How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
* <b>Base</b> <br>

  ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) <br>
     * Component-Based : React’s component-based architecture allows for building reusable, modular UI components. This improves code maintainability and reusability.<br>
     * I personally have more experiences on React, so it is comfortable and easier to use for me.

  ![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white) <br>
  
* <b>Code Consistency & Reliability</b> <br>

  ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) <br>
     * TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors early in the development process, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
     * Large-Scale Application Support: TypeScript is helps manage complexity by providing clear interfaces and type definitions, so it will be great if the app goes bigger and bigger.

* <b>Testing tool</b> <br>

  ![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/-jest-%23C21325?style=for-the-badge&logo=jest&logoColor=white) <br>
  * Built-In Assertions and Mocking: Jest comes with built-in assertion and mocking capabilities, making it a comprehensive testing solution without needing additional libraries.
  * Great Integration with React: Jest integrates seamlessly with React, providing features specifically designed for testing React components.

* <b>Others</b> <br>
  ![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-%238DD6F9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack&logoColor=black) <br>
  * Development and Production Modes: Webpack provides different configurations for development and production. It helps me develop and deploy quickly.
  * Asset Management: Webpack can manage and bundle various assets like images, CSS, and fonts.
